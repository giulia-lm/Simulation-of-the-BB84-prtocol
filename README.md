# Simulation of the BB84 protocol
This project simulates the BB84 protocol, proposed by Bennett & Brassard in 1984, using PennyLane. It demonstrates the protocol's robustness through probabilistic metrics such as entropy and mutual information.

## Description
This is an exploratory, educational implementation aimed at illustrating the security of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol.

## Getting Started

### Libraries used
- pennylane


### Project files
This repository includes the following key files:
- `bb84_pennylane.ipynb`: Main notebook with step-by-step explanations and graphical results.
- `bb84_pennylane.py`: Script to run the protocol directly on your device. To execute:
  `python3 bb84_pennylane.py` Follow the on-screen instructions to set the protocol parameters.
