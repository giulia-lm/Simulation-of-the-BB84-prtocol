# Exploring text encryption with DistilBERT
This project simulates the popular protocol proposed by Brennet & Brassard in 1984, using pennylane and showing its robusty with different probabilistic metrics such as Entropy and Mutual information. 

## Description
The project represents a exploratory and learning implementation to show the security of the protocol.

## Getting Started

### Libraries used
- pennylane


### Project files
This repository includes the following key files:
- `bb84_pennylane.ipynb`: Main notebook with step-by-step explanations of the project and graphic results.
- `bb84_pennylane.py`: Script to run the protocol in your device, to do it, you just need to execute:
  `python3 bb84_pennylane.py` and a couple of simple instructions will be given for the parameters of the protocol.

## Notes
This simulation it's part of a project was developed as a summer research for the "XXVII VERANO de la Investigación en Ciencias y Humanidades del Estado de Morelos" program under the tutoring of the Dr. Carlos Andrés González Gutiérrez.
